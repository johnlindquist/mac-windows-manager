### Size Specifications

You can specify custom sizes for width and height using the following format:

- Percentage: e.g., `width-50%` (50% of screen width)
- Pixels: e.g., `height-800px` (800 pixels high)

If no size is specified, the current window size is maintained.

### Examples

1. Center the window and set it to 80% of screen width and 70% of screen height:

   ```
   mwm center width-80% height-70%
   ```

2. Move the window to the top-right corner and set its width to 1000 pixels:

   ```
   mwm top-right width-1000px
   ```

3. Position the window on the left side of the screen and maximize its height:

   ```
   mwm left maximize-height
   ```

4. Center the window and set its size to 60% of the screen:

   ```
   mwm center-60
   ```

5. Move the window to the next display:

   ```
   mwm display-next
   ```

6. Move the window to the previous display:

   ```
   mwm display-previous
   ```

7. List all available screens:

   ```
   mwm list-screens
   ```

8. Apply a preset to open and arrange Safari and Terminal horizontally:

   ```
   mwm preset horizontal Safari:50 Terminal:50
   ```

9. Apply a preset on the second monitor to arrange Visual Studio Code and Terminal vertically:

### Help

You can access the help information by running the tool with the `-h` or `--help` flag:

```
mwm -h
```

or

```
mwm --help
```

This will display the available commands, size specifications, and examples.

## How it works

mwm uses the macOS Accessibility API to identify the frontmost application and its frontmost window. It then calculates the appropriate position and size based on the command and arguments provided, and applies these changes to the window.
